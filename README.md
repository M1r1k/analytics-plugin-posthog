# @metro-fs/analytics-plugin-posthog

## Important note for the 1.0 release
If your project is using Typescript, you'll get an error when trying to use feature flags: `Property 'posthog' does not exist on type 'Plugins'`. Please ignore it for now, as it needs a type fix in the base library.  
You can track progress [HERE](https://github.com/DavidWells/analytics/issues/266).
